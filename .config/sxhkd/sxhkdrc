# Always capture the cursor, unless making a selection without a delay
# Currently, scrot can't grab the pointer when doing both a selection and a delay and clicking on a drop-down menu, regardless of whether you are telling it to capture the cursor.
#
# If none of the bottom keys are pressed, just take a screenshot and save it.
# When a monitor key is pressed, capture that monitor.
# When the selection key is pressed, make a selection.
# When a delay key is pressed, add a 5 second delay.
# When the upload key is pressed, don't save the screenshot locally (or delete it after upload) and upload it.
# When the open key is pressed, if the upload key is pressed, upload the screenshot and open its url in Firefox, otherwise open the local screenshot in the image viewer.
# When the clipboard key is pressed, if the upload key is pressed, copy the screenshot url to the clipboard. Otherwise, do nothing.
